##ANALYSIS
Usually managed VPS services are targeted towards medium-to-large-to-enterprise scale customers.
The cost of these managed services is far too expensive for the typical developer or startup business.
The complexity, however, of unmanaged services are on the far-right. Sysadmins.io can sit in between Godaddy and Managed services
in terms of total complexity and abstraction. However, it remains much much cheaper than the managed services. 

If a customer pivot segment is necessary, SAIO might fit into the far-left of the complexity graph

Customer levels:
1: Non-technical, not comfortable with tech.
2: Somewhat technical. Comfortable with technology and computers or even good at them
3. System administrator knowledge already possessed
