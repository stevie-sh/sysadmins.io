##Second User Test

###Kind of customer:
CMSC student in college - interested in learning - set up a django app doesnt know how to start on system administration.

LEVEL 2 Tech 

##Description:
Problem: Hi, I'm having issues figuring out how to connect the domain name I just purchased from name cheap with either 1. Heroku, or 2. Digital Ocean. I'm deploying a Django app and am having trouble understanding how and where to start, as well as where my domain gets registered on the Django side. All the code in my framework is currently running through local host. Thanks :)

###Chat Transcript:

i think it's zevin8888
Stephen
Here let's do it through chat
this time
Doesn't seem to make a big difference anyways
Okay -- act like you don't know me.
Hi Kevin,

I got your ticket regarding connecting domain names with hosting services.
So you have currently purchased a domain from www.namecheap.com correct?
Namecheap.com â€¢ Cheap Domain Name Registration & Web Hosting

namecheap.com

Kevin
wait hold on, what's your email?
Stephen
Have you made a choice between Heroku or Digital Ocean?
webmaster@sysadmins.io

Kevin
sent you a google chat invite, your log will be cleaner that way
Stephen
For privacy reasons?
https://plus.google.com/hangouts/_/gsxbfd47nynq6ywnuhkagme4wya
if you want to chat on hangouts im okay with that

Kevin
lol you're really going far with sysadmins grin emoticon
i'm assuming you took funding?
Stephen
nope not yet
Can I ask you a couple questions about your experience? Whenever it is most convenient for you.

Kevin
yeah go for it
although I don't think my issues were necessarily super like difficult since I haven't had to deal with any real server issues yet
Stephen
Would you use the service again?
We can talk on the phone tomorrow

Kevin
yeah for sure
Stephen
if that's more conveneint

Kevin
for like questions I have? or just to chat in general
Stephen
for MY questions hahah

Kevin
haha
Stephen
about your general experience

Kevin
it would be, but i'm in canada atm with family, so no phone signal + only get online at night
feel free to chat here though
Stephen
oh okay
So you said you would use the service again.

Kevin
yup
Stephen
If the system administrator had said that he/she would just set the server up for you would you have taken that offer?

Kevin
Hmm
From my POV as a student, and someone who wants to learn this, probably not
I can see a market for someone who is facing a time constraint, and more businessy wanting someone to set it up for them
Stephen
What if we would set up the server for you for free. However you would have to pay for the documentation and the video tutorial on how it was done -- this way you are still learning what really occurred

Kevin
however it might be a narrow market, given that really businessy people would probably outsource most of the dev work to a company or group who would know how to do that anyways
haha
I think I might, however i'm also pretty price elastic right now, given that I don't have much money. But if it's cheap, I probably would
Stephen
?
oh okay
got it!

Kevin
If you can create an all in one explanation, like "setting up any type of server and maintaining it for dummies" kinda thing, I probably would get that
maybe not a subscription, but more of a "here's a package of videos and guides that I can buy"
Stephen
This hypothetical video that I had mentioned before would be specifically for your situation
Would that attract you? Granted that it is less than $10

Kevin
for one video or more?
Stephen
One video on how to solve your exact ticket. That is we set up the server for you and show you exactly how we did it.

Kevin
so the price would change depending on my ticket
Stephen
Maybe. Just think that it's less than $10 right now
Y or N and then a couple words explaining why

Kevin
So you wouldn't have gone through the explanations that we discussed during the chat
the video would essentially cover that?
Stephen
Oh I meant the video would cover how we set up your server

Kevin
I can't say a definite yes, but I would be interested
Stephen
Would you trust sysadmins.io with access to your server?

Kevin
lol that's unfair cause I know you
Stephen
Well I won't be the one managing your server

Kevin
so if you guys set up the server, will I be able to manage it on my own?
or is that not recommended
I thought you guys just set it up, and we maintained it after learning about it
Stephen
By access to your server I mean  access to your server to fix your problems
So you said you couldn't get it set up
We set it up for you
and then hand over the credentials
But you never know if we did anything malicious during the process
does this worry you?

Kevin
Personally my project, I have nothing to lose, but yes, I would be worried if I were a business owner
Stephen
Of the following methods of communication: Voice, Chat, Video, Email -- If you had to pick one form of communication for this type of situation which would you pick?

Kevin
Why don't you guys walk the person through it instead? Like do a screen share thing, and have them change their credentials after or something
Stephen
You mean we screenshare on our side?

Kevin
for me, chatting was fine, but everyone has different preferences. If I was super struggling, I would want some skype/screen share
on my side
that way you don't really touch my server
but it wouldn't really be scalable I guess from your end
Stephen
How much would you pay for the resolution of the ticket you just submitted?

A. None
B. < $1.99
C. < $4.99
D. < $9.99
E. < $19.99

Kevin
Haha mine? I'm a cheap asian, probably B (maybe C). If I was struggling hard core with some sysadmin stuff probably wouldn't mind E.
Stephen
So E is your choice?

Kevin
nah, for this particular instance, probably C
Stephen
Great!
Thanks
Would a subscription model i.e. 10 tickets a month interest you if the price is right? Or do you prefer a per-ticket model

Kevin
per-ticket
Stephen
Awesome! Thanks for your help. Let me know if anything else comes up.
That's it.
Give me your venmo or paypal and i can send you over the $ for beta-testing!

Kevin
Lol if you want you can venmo my fb, but you don't need to man, we're all friends smile emoticon
doesn't feel right, esp since I might bug you with more questions later when I actually set things up smile emoticon
Stephen
Hahahaha

Here's 2 bucks
a resolution
Anyways i'll keep shooting you questions
and if you have friends in a similar situation
send them over my way

## SUMMARy

1. Service again? Yes
2. Offered to setup your server would you have taken? No.
3. What if we had taught you how it was done? Yes to the free + transparency model as long as it is cheap.
4. Would you trust us with acccess to server? Yes as persona, no as a business owner.
5. No interest in subscription model.
6. Price at $4.99 is fair willing to go up to $20 for more extnesive problems.


##STEVES NOTES
in this interaction i found out that we need a way to handle less complex tickets. That is, we may have to organize tickets
based on difficulty. This ticket was easy to handle but seemed to take longer.

Additionally, should we split some of the questions that came up into multiple for each?
Are we supposed to try to teach our users?




NOTED: NEED TO HAVE PERSISTENT TRANSCRIPT
noted also that having this history makes this stuff eaiser
